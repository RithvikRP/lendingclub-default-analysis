Insight

The most important finding is that the portfolio’s per‑grade default rate rises steadily from A through G, and 60‑month loans exhibit materially higher default rates than 36‑month loans within the same grade, consistent with how LendingClub grades encode increasing probability of default.

This pattern indicates that grade and term jointly segment risk, so concentrating approvals in lower grades or longer terms will mechanically raise realized charge‑offs under the strict “Charged Off” definition used in the analysis.

Actionable recommendation

Implement targeted credit‑policy and pricing adjustments for lower grades and especially for 60‑month terms—examples include higher minimum income, lower maximum DTI, or higher rate floors—then monitor post‑change default rates by grade×term in a lightweight dashboard fed by the Part 1 view.

This brings expected losses back within portfolio targets by aligning eligibility and price with observed risk segmentation, rather than relying solely on headline rates to compensate for elevated charge‑off incidence.

Follow‑up

A likely question is whether the higher rates offered to lower grades and longer terms fully compensate for their higher default risk on a net, risk‑adjusted return basis after expected losses and fees.

The solution would be to prepare a cohort analysis by grade×term computing expected return per loan
